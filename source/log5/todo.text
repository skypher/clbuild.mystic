Be nice to have when-logging to wrap extra code. But 
  what would when-logging mean? When any sender is active for
  the category? A separate. similar non-sender sender...?
  maybe that?

- with-context-for category context &body body

- compile-time-category-spec (how do you use this?)

sender name should be canonized

print methods for senders

;;?? suppose we have a computation that outputs 
;; multiple bits of information that we'd like to
;; offer separately. How can we do the computation
;; just once

for configuration
  need to massage to handle well know locations 
  which are??

(log5:start-sender (log5:stream-sender :location *standard-output*)
  :output-spec (time log5:message)
  :category-spec (or info maintenance))

log rotation

stuff with active-categories initialization is very hacky

with-sender ... ?

May need to split senders into an accepter and an outpute

reset-categories! should stop-all-senders too (warn first?)

what should start-sender `name` do when there is already a sender named `name`?
  stop the existing (maybe a parameter)

benchmark using restarts versus not using them

log-for has an ignore-errors wrapped around it...
  could be a dev/deploy distinction

periodic logger (I made one in agraph)

log-if

tests

? stop-logs

~ contexts

context in property-spec

stack-trace
  port 

ok - Are categories in their own package? (in log5?) in the package in which 
  they are defined? 
  Currently, we put 'em in log5; but we should leave 'em where they are
ok - Define and export the various 'levels'
ok - seems we need lazy array resizing... 
  why doesn't log-for update the environment
ok - strings in property-spec
ok - boolean category combinations
ok - need to be able to startup logs from an initialization file 
no - How about a default category that log-message uses (or log-for nil means
    use the default). I think that this would make things too unclear
ok - get unhelpful error if try to log for non-existent category
